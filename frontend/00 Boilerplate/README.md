# 00 Boilerplate

In this sample we are going to setup the basic plumbing to "build" our project and launch it in a dev server.

# Steps

- We are going to add a basic webpack configuration (splitted into production and development) based in TypeScript, Webpack and React.

- Then we will add components that we had used on [`react-by-sample`](https://github.com/Lemoncode/react-by-sample):
    - 12 TableHttp sample
    - 15 LoginForm sample
    - 16 Validation sample

- Add basic redux plumbing.
