# Jest testing by sample

Learn testing with jest by sample, each of the samples contains a readme.md file that indicates the purpose of the sample plus an step by step guide to reproduce it.

Example projects are located under the _frontend_ folder, each sample covers a testing topic and includes and step by step guide.

How to run the sample projects:

Jump into _frontend_ folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Then jump into one of the examples folder you want to run, e.g. _02 PlainVanilla_ 

```bash
cd "02 PlainVanilla"
```

Now you can execute the tests by launching:

```bash
npm test
```

You can start the project by executing:

```bash
npm start
```

Each sample contains a _Readme.md_ that contains the step by step guide to reproduce the sample.
